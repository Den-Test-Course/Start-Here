# Module 2: Environment Setup & Security Configuration
## Instructor Guide

## üéØ Module Overview
This module focuses on setting up a secure and scalable environment for AI model deployment in enterprise settings. Students will learn about Azure OpenAI's architecture, security considerations, and best practices for production deployments.

## üß† Theoretical Background

### Azure OpenAI Service Architecture
```mermaid

    A[Client Application] --> B[Azure OpenAI Service]
    B --> C[Model Deployment]
    C --> D[GPT-4]
    B --> E[Security Layer]
    E --> F[Authentication]
    E --> G[RBAC]
    E --> H[Network Security]
```

Key Points to Explain:
- Azure OpenAI as a managed service layer
- Model deployment and versioning
- Security integration with Azure ecosystem
- Role of each component in the architecture

### Enterprise Data Flow
```mermaid

    participant App
    participant Azure
    participant Model
    participant Monitor
    App->>Azure: API Request
    Azure->>Azure: Auth Check
    Azure->>Model: Process Request
    Model->>Azure: Response
    Azure->>Monitor: Log Activity
    Azure->>App: Return Response
```

Teaching Notes:
1. Emphasize the request lifecycle
2. Point out security checkpoints
3. Discuss monitoring importance
4. Explain error handling

### Security Architecture
```mermaid

    A[Enterprise Network] --> B[Azure AD]
    B --> C[Resource Group]
    C --> D[OpenAI Service]
    D --> E[Model Endpoint]
    B --> F[RBAC Policies]
    F --> D
    G[Monitoring] --> D
```

Key Security Concepts:
- Azure Active Directory integration
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Network security groups
- Monitoring and auditing

### Deployment Process
