## üî® Hands-on Labs

### Lab 1: Environment Configuration

```python
# Example: Configure Azure OpenAI client with secure credentials
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
from azure.ai.openai import OpenAIClient

def setup_secure_client():
    # Get credentials from Azure AD
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    
    # Access secrets from Key Vault
    key_vault_url = "https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/"
    secret_client = SecretClient(vault_url=key_vault_url, credential=credential)
    
    # Get OpenAI configuration
    endpoint = secret_client.get_secret("openai-endpoint").value
    
    # Create secure client
    client = OpenAIClient(
        endpoint=endpoint,
        credential=credential
    )
    return client
```

### Lab 2: Security Implementation

```python
# Example: Implement RBAC checks
def validate_access(client, resource_type):
    try:
        # Check if user has required roles
        roles = get_user_roles(client)
        required_roles = get_required_roles(resource_type)
        
        return all(role in roles for role in required_roles)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Access validation failed: {e}")
        return False
```

### Lab 3: Monitoring Setup

```python
# Example: Configure monitoring
def setup_monitoring():
    # Initialize monitoring client
    monitor_client = MonitoringClient()
    
    # Define metrics to track
    metrics = [
        "requests_per_minute",
        "response_time",
        "error_rate",
        "token_usage"
    ]
    
    # Set up alerts
    for metric in metrics:
        monitor_client.create_alert_rule(
            metric_name=metric,
            threshold=get_threshold(metric),
            window_size="5m"
        )
```
